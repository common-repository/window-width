A simple addition to the WordPress admin bar that displays the current viewport width.

== Description ==

A simple addition to the WordPress admin bar that displays the current viewport width.
Uses the lovely [`viewportSize` jQuery plugin](http://github.com/tysonmatanich/viewportSize) by [Tyson Matanich](http://matanich.com/).

== Installation ==

Install like any other plugin:

1. Upload the `/window-width` folder from your download to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your site.
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin.
3. Rejoice.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are more features coming? =

Probably not – this is meant to be an extremely simple utility.

= Does this work fine with the new responsive admin bar introduced in WordPress 3.8? =

Yes, the window width displays fine in the admin bar – even in smaller viewport sizes.

= Does the width only display in pixels? =

Currently, yes.


== Screenshots ==

1. The window width displays right in the admin bar – this screenshot shows it in the admin.
2. This screenshot shows where Window Width is often most useful: on the front-end of your site, handy for theme development.
3. In this screenshot, an obnoxious red arrow points out how the window width persists in the WordPress admin bar even in its minified responsive view.
